###What is the concept?

The concept was to recreate the old school visualisations of the windows media player through processing. Collaborating it with modern visualisations as well as being audio-reactive, i wanted to blend these two worlds together.

###How was it created?

It was created using Windows Media Player Version 7. 

###How does it work?

It creates colours and visualisations based on the music that you provide it. 

###Why do i like the visuals?

Itâ€™s very nostalgic and brings me back to my childhood growing up with a PC. It allows me to see how i can bring something from the past back into the present modern world and still be appreciated.
